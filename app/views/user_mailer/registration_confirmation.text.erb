Welcome to the Empanada Intifada's "Street Eats Beat." The Empanada is mystery wrapped in a flaky crust. Hopefully we can help you unwrap it. 

From henceforth, we will try to ensure that a letter comes to your inbox once a week.  Sometimes it will be a pre-cap of our weekly plan.  Sometimes we will have information about interesting things other trucks and pop-ups are doing.  Sometimes it will be long, sometimes short.  Sometimes we will forget to write it.  

We're interested in getting to know you, our regular empanada eaters.  If you have concerns, comments, compliments, or cool stories, we want to hear them.  We're still learning as we go - help us become the best spot(s) to eat in New Orleans by giving us a little feedback every once in a while.  Email empanada.intifada@gmail.com anytime you like.
