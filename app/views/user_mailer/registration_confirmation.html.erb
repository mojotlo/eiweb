<p>Howdy <%= @user.name.split[0] %>,</p>
<p>Welcome to the Empanada Intifada's "Street Eats Beat." The Empanada is mystery wrapped in a flaky crust. Hopefully we can help you unwrap it. </p>

<p>From henceforth, we will try to ensure that a letter comes to your inbox once a week.  Sometimes it will be a pre-cap of our weekly plan.  Sometimes we will have information about interesting things other trucks and pop-ups are doing.  Sometimes it will be long, sometimes short.  Sometimes we will forget to write it.  
</p>

<p>
We're interested in getting to know you, our regular empanada eaters.  If you have concerns, comments, compliments, or cool stories, we want to hear them.  We're still learning as we go - help us become the best spot(s) to eat in New Orleans by giving us a little feedback every once in a while.  Email empanada.intifada@gmail.com anytime you like.
